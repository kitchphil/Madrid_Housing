## Madrid Housing
A project about the Madrid Housing market, monthly rental income against Airbnb income. 


## Motivation
I wanted to look at the difference between the benefits of buying to let, airbnb or sell on.

This also has culiminated with the Dashboard, which will allow me to monitor the details in each neighbourhood of Madrid, grouped by their districts. 


## Code style
This notebook uses:

- Python
- SQL
- Dash

*Many of the datasets were very large, so was unable to upload to github. If you would like the necessary datasets, please contact me*
